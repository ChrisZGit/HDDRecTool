RAIDs are a good way to prevent data loss in case of hardware defects like a broken harddisc. For the IT forensics the recovery of data is an important field. For the course 'Forensic Hacks' at Friedrich-Alexander-University lectured by Dr.-Ing. Andreas Dewald we had to implement a recoverer for different RAID levels (RAID 0, RAID 1, RAID 5). The goal was to automatically estimate parameters used by the raidcontroller like the raidsystem, stripesize and the corresponding stripemap.
"Raid faster - recover better" (rfrb v0.5.1) uses an algorithm with entropies and heuristics to locate entropygaps. There is a high chance that these gaps lead to blockedges which can show stripechunks. Using metaheuristics the corresponding stripemap can be evaluated.
We put our focus on performance to increase read-/write-throughput to ensure that even big image can be recovered in a reasonable time.
The idea of using entropygaps as indicators for blockedges still needs improvements to guarantee reliable results in every case.
